We started with a simple question, if we have so many NGO's and good people in this world, why we are not able to solve these problems. And answer we have got is that individual people who are majority of us are not empowered , don't have skills, don't know what to do. People are not aware of thier individual impact and how they can contribute to solve world problem.Some people, organisation and NGO's are fixing individual symptoms and are working in Silos. All of this is happening across the world but not organised in a single direction and vision. We plan to have a holistic solution for all that encompass the world problems and how a normal individual like you can solve the problem himself instead of waiting for someone to fix it for you. Our vision is to empower individuals to tackle global problem and not to start donation campaign as used by various organisation to solve world probem. It has to be taken up by you as an individual cell and how you can yourself be a more conscious individual and take action.We are creating a foundation layer that connects everyone together in one vision and direction and provide tools, framework and skills so that you can use it in your daily life and solve problems.

Most of the people when they consume stuff are not aware how that impact the planet. e.g. Baby Diapers take 600 years to biodegrade A normal person don't know the implications of like increase in earth temperature beyond 1.5 degree celsius and how we all are contributing in it.
