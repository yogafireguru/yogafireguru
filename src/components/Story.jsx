                 <b>It was mid of June 2017, i was visiting my doctor. This was not uncommon for me, after having diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 25 it was a normal routine from past 8 years. I had been on regular medication since that day, with no cure for my illness. I was suffering with acute abdomen pain a few days back and the results of my latest liver fibroscan were out that day. Then doctor started explaining me that how my liver has become so fatty that it is nearing liver cirrhosis, making chances of liver cancer upto 200%. Till that time i never took things seriously in life, but that was enough to shake me up. And i asked a simple question why after taking my medicines for 8 years no doctor is able to cure me. I was never a believer of God, so i did not know where to find him, or does he even existed. So i asked a simple question to myself Why Me? and i took the responsibility to sort it out myself becasue i had enough of my unhealthy lifestyle. So i started with a resolution to get my health sorted, i started practicing Yoga and mindfullness (staying in current moment) and dedicated my 4 hours each day for next 1.5 year on my health by doing various yoga exercises. As a result i lost not only weight, but it was first time in years where i had complete control on my diabetes where i took not a single medicine for 1.5 years and i am still continuing on that path. Life was great again, as i was able to completely transform and change my life.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 But suddenly one night i woke up, and for the very first time looking at my son who was sleeping next to me, i saw various kids his age who were homeless and were lying on delhi streets. That was not a dream as i was fully awake, but from past 1.5 years i was focusing on living in current moment and not in Past and Future and trap of my mind, that incident on that night altered my perception about my world and how i saw it. For the very first time i saw something that i never took notice of. I mean i had seen kids before who were begging on delhi street, but experiencing those as like my Kids was something i never experienced before, that night brought tears in my eyes, for the very first time in my life. I had been working in IT field as an Architect for years where i focussed on bringing various ideas on table and provided an optimised solution for various problems. I was doing it for years which i enjoyed but never ever i applied my skills on something like solving these real problems. Next few days i looked at homelessness problem, after research i came to know about all <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">UN Sustainable Development Goals</a>. <br/><br/> For a person like me who has been doing his job and working for his family and himself, i asked one simple question, How can i solve it. That question laid the foundation of YogaFire. The site you see today is not a 1 day job, it took me a Year to finally clear my Why, How and What after seeing lot of failures. I even took part time off from my job where i completed <a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Digital Fabrication Diploma </a> and i am <a href="http://fabacademy.org/students/alumni-list.html">2019 Alumni Graduate</a>. Not only that i finally found my answer of Why me ? Why i had diabetes ? , Call it sixth sense but i have a theory which i tested for 1 year on real people and situations and that explains why we are unable to tackle World Problems today. <br/><br/> Answer is simple actually if you look at your body you are made of cells, so is everyone around you. When you get sick something in your body the cells don't work in harmony with each other. It may be caused by a Virus or anything, but key is system has been compromised. I had diabetes because my body, mind emotions and energy were not in sync. My cells which are designed for health were not working for me. If you apply same principle and see yourself as a Cell of Planet earth you will see you all are working against it. When you buy a baby diaper that take 600 years to decompose, or buy a cup of coffee or go to shopping complex or eat bad food. All of us are causing harm to the planet. We are the reason why we have so many problems. Our Cells in our body works together , they take care for us so that we can live a healthy life but in real world we don't colloborate, we don't share with each other, leave stuff for God to sort out for us, We don't take responsibility of our own actions. <br/><br/>I know the reason well, current world economy is far important than ecology, individual survival is far important than group survival. We are all stuck in survival, false expectations of economy model where success is defined by how much money you have, what is your social status and how many instagram followers you have. We all need money we all need comfort and conveneince. In nutshell we are just like a cancer cell which takes and takes but never give back or work for anyone else wellbeing. <br/><br/>I envision to change that, this theory i have applied on myself for past one year where i have tried to live and work like a normal cell. But majority of the people(cells) i met just wanted to take something from me, very few actually willing to share. I don't blame them. This is how we have been conditioned in our society. This is the ground reality where every person i see first asks me what he will get out of it. But when i ask them a question on What does a cell get out when it dies for you saving you from diseases? What a tree get? What a planet get out of you as a species?. Don't you think their is not much a difference in the mentality of a Cancer Cell(that consumes 20% percent more energy then normal cell) and us as Humans. <br/><br/>Its not that i just met cancer cells, though they were the majority but cells who were willing to help me but with same common patterns and challenges, and that was they were like me they were not aware of these massive problems, they did not know how to tackle it like me, majority don't had money, they don't had tools and skills to contribute and solve. So even if they wanted to help they were unable to do it. That is the very reason i started YogaFire to build the initial foundation layer so that all such cells can be empowered, so that they don't remain hopeless. So if you are someone who thinks he/she is nothing join us as a cell. I will show you how you can think like a cell, work like a cell, improve like a cell, contribute like a cell, doing all things opposite to a Cancer Cell and defeat world problems and take care of your survival in that process. Only thing that you need to do is work on yourself. I am builidng tools, community and framework for all of you to work like a cell. YogaFire is that fire that binds us together. May that fire lights up within you too someday.
